#SPHARM-PDM Toolbox

##What is it?

Shape analysis has become of increasing interest to the medical community due to its potential to precisely locate morphological changes between healthy and pathological structures. SPHARM-PDM is a tool that computes point-based models using a parametric boundary description for the computing of Shape analysis.

The point-based models computed with the SPHARM-PDM tool can be used in combination with the also UNC designed statistical tool shapeAnalysisMANCOVA to perform quantitative morphological assessment of structural changes at speciÔ¨Åc locations.

SPHARM-PDM is now available as a 3D Slicer extension (http://www.slicer.org)
